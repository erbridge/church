The trees have grown darker and gnarled over the years, and since anyone remembers, there have been no wild animals in sight. Hunting is hard. Living is harder.","\n","^The months are starting to grow cold and the nights long, and fear bubbles under the surface like a tar pit.","\n","^Something needs to be done, but no one knows what.","\n","^A committee meets once a week around the communal well, to discuss matters of the village, births and deaths and crimes and punishment.","\n","^This week they are silent. Scared.","\n","^They have, in private, made offerings and pleas to the forces they don't understand, carved approximations of powerful beings they haven't seen except in shadowy dreams.","\n","^There is a sense that something will save them if only they can name it.","\n","^One of the older committee members speaks. His voice is clear and decisive but he cannot hide the tremble that betrays him.","\n","^\"Let us build a house,\" he begins, and the others look up questioningly.","\n","^\"We look for help, but we don't yet know where it is. Perhaps the solution is to let help come to us. Let us build a house, and whatever it is will have a space to be.\"","\n","^You cannot hear the whispers in the woods beyond the sounds of hammer meeting nail.","\n","done",{"#f":3}],"#f":3}],"listDefs":{}}
